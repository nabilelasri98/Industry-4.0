# Industry-4.0
This repository collects an example of a Data Science project applied in Industry 4.0. 

The objective of this project is to determine the water level and outflow rate of an Italian reservoir seven days in advance in order to limit flood risks, provide water resources for public use, and generate hydropower.
The result obtained are two regression models capable of making the required predictions, for the different targets (water level and outflow rate)
